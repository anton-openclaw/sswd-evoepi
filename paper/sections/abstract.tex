% Abstract — placeholder for Phase 1
Sea star wasting disease (SSWD) has caused unprecedented mass mortality in \pyc{} across the northeastern Pacific since 2013. We present \modelname{}, an individual-based, spatially explicit eco-evolutionary epidemiological model coupling \vpshort{} disease dynamics with polygenic host resistance, tolerance, and recovery evolution under sweepstake reproductive success. [To be completed in Phase 1.]
