\begin{abstract}
This document develops the theoretical framework for using the SSWD-EvoEpi 
agent-based model to inform conservation breeding and reintroduction of 
\pyc{} (sunflower sea star). We derive from first principles the 
quantitative genetics of polygenic disease resistance, the statistical 
theory of founder screening, optimal breeding program design under 
inbreeding constraints, and the population genetics of genetic rescue 
through reintroduction. Each section connects mathematical theory to 
the specific genetic architecture implemented in the model (51 biallelic 
loci across three traits), generating concrete predictions that become 
testable once the model is calibrated. The module includes code 
implementations of all theoretical results and analysis templates 
ready for execution with final model parameters.
