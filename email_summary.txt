SSWD-EvoEpi Overnight Data Pipeline Report - Sunday Feb 16, 2026 5:10 AM PST

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Mixed Success - Comprehensive site database and unified coastline complete, but overwater distance module has critical performance bottlenecks.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
✅ 489 COASTAL SITES merged from 13 regional datasets
- Complete NE Pacific coverage (26.7N to 61.1N)
- 287/489 sites (58.7%) with Pycnopodia documentation  
- Alaska leads with 97-100% documentation
- Site map visualization created

✅ UNIFIED NE PACIFIC COASTLINE assembled
- 1.9MB GeoJSON with 25,948 vertices 
- Production-ready for modeling
- Complete visualization with site overlay

✅ OVERWATER DISTANCE MODULE implemented
- Complete 877-line Python implementation
- Full API with OverwaterDistanceCalculator class

CRITICAL ISSUE:
❌ Overwater distance performance bottleneck - graph construction hangs on realistic datasets (>60s timeout). Cannot compute spatial connectivity matrices. Must continue using Haversine approximation until fixed.

REGIONAL BREAKDOWN:
Alaska regions: 150 sites total, 97-100% Pycnopodia coverage
BC regions: 77 sites, mixed coverage (BC-N 100%, BC-C 0%)  
US West Coast: 261 sites, variable coverage (OR 100%, CA mixed)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix overwater distance performance (CRITICAL)
2. Alternative distance methods investigation
3. Proceed with model development using site/coastline data
