"""SSWD-EvoEpi: Coupled eco-evolutionary model of sea star wasting disease.

A spatially explicit, individual-based model coupling:
  - Population dynamics with sweepstakes reproductive success (SRS)
  - SEIPD+P disease dynamics for V. pectenicida / SSWD
  - Three-trait polygenic evolution (17R/17T/17C = 51 loci)
  - Metapopulation connectivity via larval and pathogen dispersal
  - Conservation intervention scenarios (captive breeding, AGF)
