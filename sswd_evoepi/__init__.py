"""SSWD-EvoEpi: Coupled eco-evolutionary model of sea star wasting disease.

A spatially explicit, individual-based model coupling:
  - Population dynamics with sweepstakes reproductive success (SRS)
  - SEIPD+P disease dynamics for V. pectenicida / SSWD
  - Polygenic resistance evolution (51 additive + 1 overdominant locus)
  - Metapopulation connectivity via larval and pathogen dispersal
  - Conservation intervention scenarios (captive breeding, AGF)
