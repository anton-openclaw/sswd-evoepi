# Expected outcome: ~99% population crash with slow stochastic recovery

name: "No intervention baseline"
description: >
  Baseline run with no reintroduction. Simulates SSWD outbreak onset in
  2013 and tracks natural population dynamics for 20 years. All recovery
  must come from in-situ evolution of resistance, tolerance, and recovery
  traits in the remaining wild population.
